# weather-dashboard

Welcome to the weather dashboard! In this app you will find that looking up the weather is easy as typing a city, state, country, or continent. Once the area has been typed in, you will be given a 5 day forecast showing the temperature, humidity, and the weather conditions. With the searches that get listed below for your own references, you may click those listed searches and be brought to the same weather stats that you would if it was to be searched!
